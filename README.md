# micrograd_local

Welcome to micrograd_local! This is a personal re-implementation of Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd), intended to deepen my knowledge on backpropagation and neural networks.

## Installation

To get started with micrograd_local, it's recommended to use `pyenv` and `virtualenv` for managing your Python environment. Here's how you can set up the environment and install the required dependencies:
If you don't have `pyenv` installed, you can follow the installation instructions from the [pyenv GitHub repository](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation).
